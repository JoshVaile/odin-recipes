    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Spaghetti and Meatballs is a dish that is appreicated by many. It's a dish that is both simple and complex. The sweetness of the sauce along with the saltyness of the meatballs are
        a perfect pairing. Adding things to this dish only helps it be more complex. Sides like garlic bread are even better.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 small yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves or 4 teaspoons dried parsley leaves, plus more for serving if using fresh (optional)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup), plus more for serving</li>
        <li>1/2 cups dried panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for the pasta water</li>
        <li>2 (24-ounce) jars Prego® Traditional Italian Sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound dry spaghetti</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 425°F. 
            Finely chop 1 small yellow onion (about 3/4 cup) and 2 garlic cloves. Coarsely chop 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves, then chop some more for garnish if desired.</li>
        <li>Whisk 2 large eggs in a large bowl until combined. Add 2 1/2 pounds ground beef, 2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup), 1/2 cup dried panko breadcrumbs, 
            1 tablespoon kosher salt, onion, garlic, and parsley to the bowl and mix with your hands until combined, making sure not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Form the mixture into 1-inch wide meatballs (about 2 tablespoons each). Place the meatballs in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Roast until browned and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add 1 pound dry spaghetti to the boiling water and cook until al dente according to package directions, 
            9 to 11 minutes. Drain the pasta, then return to the now-empty pot. Add 1/2 (24-ounce) jar Prego® Traditional Italian Sauce and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 1 1/2 jars Prego® Traditional Italian Sauce to a large, high-sided skillet or Dutch oven and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs 
            and spoon the sauce over the meatballs to coat. Transfer 20 meatballs and 3/4 cup sauce into a single airtight container and refrigerate for the Rollover Dinner.</li>
        <li>Transfer the spaghetti to shallow serving bowls and top with meatballs and sauce. Serve garnished with more Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley.</li>
