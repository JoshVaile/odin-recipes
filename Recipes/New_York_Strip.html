    <h2>Description</h2>
        <P>You don't need to go to a steakhouse to get quality NewYork Strip. You can make a excellent steak at home! You may think you need a large kitchen and full staff, but you don't!
            All you really need is a cast iron skillet and the proper technique.
        </P>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 (about 1 1/4-inch thick) boneless New York strip steaks (at least 12 ounces each)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>8 ounces green beans</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes (about 10 ounces)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large frying pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat just until starting to smoke. 
            Meanwhile, pat 2 New York strip steaks very dry with paper towels. Season all over with 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Add the steaks to the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Cook, flipping every 2 minutes, until the center of the steaks register 120ÂºF for medium-rare, 9 to 14 minutes total. 
            Meanwhile, trim the stems ends from 8 ounces green beans and mince 2 garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>When the steaks are ready, transfer to plates or a clean cutting board and top with a few grinds of black pepper if desired. Add the green beans and 1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes 
            to the pan and season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring rarely, until the greens beans are crisp tender and the tomatoes are blistered in 
            spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Slice the steak if desired and serve with the green beans and tomatoes.</li>
    </ol>
